                                <p>The “Temple of Heavenly Happiness” dates all the way back to the 1800s. It is dedicated to Mazu, a Chinese sea goddess, and remains an important place of worship to this day. Keep an eye for the detailed carvings and sculptures of dragons, phoenixes and deities, as well as the colourful broken porcelain on the roof ridges, a Fujian decorating technique. </p>

                                <p>Buddha Tooth Relic Temple gets its name from what the Buddhists regard as the left canine tooth of Buddha, which has been recovered from his funeral pyre in Kushinagar, India and displayed on the temple's grounds. The temple is also home to two museums, with fascinating stories about figures of note in the tradition, and sacred relics of the Buddha and his disciples.</p>
