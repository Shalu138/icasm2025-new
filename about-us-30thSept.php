                        <br />
                        <br />
                        I am excited and honored to share that the 71st International Congress of Aviation and Space Medicine (ICASM) will take place in Singapore from October 27-30, 2025.
                    </p>
                    <p>ICASM 2025 aims to unite the international community of aviation and space medicine practitioners, scientists, academicians and researchers in the sunny island of Singapore for an unforgettable experience of learning, networking and collaboration. ICASM 2025 will include a rich scientific programme spanning over 3 days as well as unique visits and tours on the last day.</p>

                    <p>The theme for ICASM 2025 is “Soaring Towards New Horizons in Aviation and Space Medicine”. My team and I will be curating a compelling and forward-looking scientific programme that will highlight the latest advancements and emerging trends in aviation and space medicine, as well as other related fields. We look forward to your valued contribution in ICASM 2025 as speakers, sponsors and participants.</p>

                    <p>The congress will be held at One Farrer Hotel, situated in one of Singapore's cultural districts. The location of this hotel holds historical significance as the first flight in Singapore took off here. On 16 March 1911, a Bristol Boxkite biplane took flight from the old Race Course at Farrer Park, the site which sits adjacent to this hotel.</p>

                    <p>One Farrer Hotel boasts a plethora of water and tropical gardens within its compounds. It also has fully operational farm which provides vegetables in the food it serves. This provides a distinctive and inspiring backdrop for our event, and showcases Singapore as a Garden City for all to enjoy.</p>

                    <p>Singapore is home to a global metropolis, a City in Nature, and a rich tapestry of rich and diverse cultures. During your stay in Singapore and as part of ICASM 2025, you will be introduced to an wide variety of food and cuisines, a stunning city skyline, and plenty of sunshine and warm weather.</p>

                    <p>I would like to extend a warm welcome to friends from all around the world to join me in Singapore for ICASM 2025. With an exciting lineup of events and activities, I am sure you will have an unforgettable experience. Collectively, we will advance aviation and space medicine knowledge, forge new friendships and soar to new horizons as one. See you in Singapore!</p>
