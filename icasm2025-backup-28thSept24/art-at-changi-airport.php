                                <p>Made up of 1,216 bronze droplets, the Kinetic Rain can form many shapes ranging from an aeroplane, to a dragon. The project is the brainchild of artists, programmers and technologists who analysed space, passenger flow, and the bustle of activity at the airport. With more than a thousand 'raindrops' working together in harmony, Kinetic Rain also symbolises the airport community collaborating to provide a positive Changi experience for all.</p>

                                <p>Daisy is inspired by the journeys and connections facilitated by Changi Airport and the Port of Singapore. Painted in Singapore's national colours of red and white, the flower-shaped propeller represents the country's diverse flora. Powered by built-in sensors, the propeller moves in response to the movements of travellers in its immediate environment.</p>

                                <p>Les Oiseaux (The Birds) is a delicately handcrafted stainless steel wire sculpture of three birds by French artist, CÃ©dric Le Borgne. One of the birds is perched on the ground while the other two are suspended in mid-air, as if they are soaring. Together, the three birds reflect the nexus between sky and earth, and between dreams and reality.</p>
