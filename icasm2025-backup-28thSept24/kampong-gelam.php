                                <p>Built in 1824 by Sultan Hussein Shah, the first Sultan of Singapore, the mosque is a vibrant symbol of the Muslim faith, and a focal point of Singapore's Malay community. The mosque's golden domes are adorned with glass bottle ends at the base, which were collected and donated by the lower-income as their contributions to the mosque's construction.</p>

Just like Singapore, this beautiful mosque is a blend of Indo-Islamic and European features seen in the traditional onion-shaped dome, Chinese glazed porcelain tiles and a minaret that resembles a church spire.</p>

                                <p>Singapore's original indie neighbourhood is a great place to wander, with its hole-in-the-wall bars, boutique fashion stores and indie business. Keep a lookout for wall murals and graffiti by both local and internationally-renowned artists.
