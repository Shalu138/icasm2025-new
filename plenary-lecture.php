                                <p>The increasing frequency and scale of infectious disease outbreaks present both challenges and unique opportunities for aviation medicine. Key drivers such as rapid unplanned urbanisation, climate change, and increased global connectivity create conditions for rapid disease spread, and the aviation and travel health sector is both a vulnerable point and a critical intervention opportunity in securing global health security. </p>
                                
                                <p>This lecture examines the evolving landscape of infectious disease threats and their implications for global air travel, while exploring innovative approaches to pandemic preparedness. From the COVID-19 pandemic to other outbreak experiences, we will explore the effectiveness of various aviation-specific interventions implemented, including novel approaches that facilitated the safe resumption of air travel, such as risk-calibrated border measures, automated public health systems, and integration of digital health/vaccine certificates.</p>

                                <p>We will discuss a modular approach to future preparedness and response, and opportunities for aviation medicine to strengthen its preparedness capabilities. These include developing scalable health operations that can be swiftly modified based on specific threat characteristics, leveraging technology to enable real-time data sharing and enhance health measures, and building robust collaborative networks for coordinated responses. These examples illustrate how aviation medicine can adapt and innovate under crisis conditions. </p>
